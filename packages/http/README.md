## About

Builds a PSR-7 `ServerRequestInterface` from the shape [Rapira](https://rapira.rs/) hands your worker, with one factory per run mode:

- **`SapiRequestFactory`** — hydrates the request from the PHP superglobals (`$_SERVER`, `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_FILES`), the shape Rapira exposes in **classic** and **worker** modes.
- **`DispatcherRequestFactory`** — hydrates it from the [`Rapira\Http\Exchange`](https://github.com/rapira-rs/contract-php) the host delivers in **dispatcher** mode, without touching the superglobals.

Both take PSR-17 factories, so you keep your project's own PSR-7 implementation.

## Install

```bash
composer require rapira/http
```

## Usage

Classic / worker mode — from the SAPI environment:

```php
use Rapira\Sdk\Http\SapiRequestFactory;

$factory = new SapiRequestFactory(
    $serverRequestFactory, // Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestFactoryInterface
    $uriFactory,           // Psr\Http\Message\UriFactoryInterface
    $uploadedFileFactory,  // Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileFactoryInterface
    $streamFactory,        // Psr\Http\Message\StreamFactoryInterface
);

$request = $factory->create();
```

Dispatcher mode — from the exchange the host delivers:

```php
use Rapira\Sdk\Http\DispatcherRequestFactory;

$factory = new DispatcherRequestFactory(
    $serverRequestFactory,
    $uploadedFileFactory,
    $streamFactory,
);

$request = $factory->create($exchange); // Rapira\Http\Exchange
```

### Dispatcher mode

Dispatcher mode is built for async code, so `DispatcherRequestFactory` builds each request from the exchange alone: it never reads or writes the superglobals and keeps no state between requests. Code that needs `$_SERVER`, `$_GET` and the rest belongs in worker mode.
